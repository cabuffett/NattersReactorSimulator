# NattersReactorSimulator
The most simple reactor SIMULATOR, not accurate to real life.
Special thanks to Google Gemini for bug testing and initial prototype XD
This was made to test Gemini's capabilities in Code Generation, will post updates as 
I go along.

# Compiling
to compile, you MUST have C++ and QT installed and configured in
your development env. Ensure you can build C++ with QT programs before
compiling this one.
